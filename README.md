# robification

An app I whipped up a while ago to get messages to my org's flowdock account which was used for notifications such as app errors, server errors, random notifications, etc. Currently works with flowdock and email, but I put the project down while I was working on SMS and slack integration which is curently incomplete. The app works like a champ and is currently in-use in a production environment using a t2-nano instance. I'll pick it back and will most likely refactor when I get the urge to play with chat ops again.
